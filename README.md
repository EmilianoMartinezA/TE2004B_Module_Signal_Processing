  Practices mainly developed in _Matlab_ , as well as in _Python_ for the final solution,
which consists of a biometric system developed for voice signal processing, detecting certain voice frequencies, 
in a continuous time graph, using tools such as the **Fast Fourier Transform** and data import
libraries for signal processing based on continuous simulated time data.
