%% LOAD YOUR SIGNAL


%% STEP 1: TIME-DOMAIN ANALYSIS

% Provide a full description of your signal based on all the time-domain
% information you can extract. For instance:
%   Plot the signal
%   Compute all signal information
%   Identify any oscillatory activity
%   Identify any noisy activity



%% STEP 2: FREQUENCY-DOMAIN ANALYSIS

% Provide a full description of your signal based on all the time-domain
% information you can extract. For instance:
%   Plot the Fourier spectrum
%   Identify any oscillatory activity
%   Identify any noisy activity



%% STEP 3: GET SIGNAL ECUATION

% Write the mathematical time-domain equation of your signal, 
% i.e., infer an equation as:
% x(t) = A1*cos(2*pi*f1*t+p1) + A2*cos(2*pi*f2*t+p2)
% Argue the seleccion of all parameters



%% STEP 4: DESING AND APPLY A FIR LOW PASS FILTER (ALLOW ONLY THE LOW-FREQ)

% Desing the filter and plot the filter frequency response
% Apply the filter using yout own implementation of the difference equation
%   and obtain the filtered signal
% Plot the magnitud frequency spectrum of the original and filtered signal
% Plot the time-domain original and filtered signal



%% STEP 5: DESING AND APPLY A IRR HIGH PASS FILTER (ALLOW ONLY THE HIGH-FREQ)


% Desing the filter and plot the filter frequency response
% Apply the filter using yout own implementation of the difference equation
%   and obtain the filtered signal
% Plot the magnitud frequency spectrum of the original and filtered signal
% Plot the time-domain original and filtered signal



%% STEP 6: DRAW CONCLUSIONS

% What are the more important lessons you learned here? Provide detailed
% several conclusions
